## Tasks.
Before teaching you more of the game it is important to enjoy playing the game more instead of seeing it as chore  so it will still be fun!
The main priority once you start are quests and world exploration. It is also important to read the dialogues instead of skipping it :)

### these tasks are mainly for early game which will still apply in the latter( Adventure rank 1 - 16 )
```
1. Activate teleport waypoints and statues of the seven
2. Complete Archon quests/ Story quests

### taks for mid game ( Adventure rank 16 - 35 )
```
1. World quests
2. Commisions
3. Using resin for artifacts and boss materials
⚠IMPORTANT NOTE⚠: Do not waste or use FRAGILE RESIN unless you run out of original resin 
and you need to claim drops instead of waiting for almost an hour.
```

Make sure to upgrade statues of the seven by offering the required -oculus (Anemoculus, Geoculus, etc.)
These are often scattered across the map and there will be a star like symbol that will appear in your mini map
when passed by one.
Upgrading the staues will increase your stamina and give you generous rewards like primogems and exp.
